🎹 Perfect Piano Game Automation
This project automates the gameplay of Perfect Piano using Python, allowing you to achieve high scores without manual interaction. The automation monitors specific regions on the screen, processes pixel data, and simulates key presses in real-time to play the game.

🚀 Key Features
Real-time Screen Monitoring: Continuously monitors predefined screen regions to detect visual cues.
Key Press Simulation: Simulates key presses ('f', 'g', 'h', 'j') based on pixel data.
Automated Gameplay: Plays the Perfect Piano game automatically by pressing the correct keys at the right time.
Multithreading: Uses multithreading to monitor multiple regions and simulate key presses simultaneously.
🧠 How It Works
Screen Monitoring: The script captures specific regions of the screen where keys need to be pressed.
Image Processing: Using OpenCV, the captured images are converted to grayscale and flattened for pixel analysis.
Pixel Detection: The script checks if pixel intensity falls within a predefined range to determine if a key press is needed.
Simulating Key Presses: Once the necessary condition is met, PyAutoGUI simulates the corresponding key press ('f', 'g', 'h', 'j').
Multithreaded Execution: The script runs four threads simultaneously, each handling a different region of the screen to monitor and simulate key presses efficiently.
🖥️ Requirements
To run the project, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

pyautogui: To simulate keyboard presses.
opencv-python (cv2): For image processing.
numpy: To handle pixel data.
mss: For fast and efficient screen capturing.
threading: For multithreaded execution (built-in Python library).
You can install the dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pyautogui opencv-python numpy mss
📄 How to Run
Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Perfect-Piano-Automation.git
Navigate to the Project Directory
Move into the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd Perfect-Piano-Automation
Run the Script
Finally, run the Python script to start automating the game:

bash
Copy code
python perfect_piano_automation.py
🏆 Achieved Score
This automation has successfully achieved a score of 7200 in the Perfect Piano game! 🎉

The program plays the game flawlessly by detecting the right time to press the keys, resulting in a high score.

⚙️ Configuration
You may need to tweak the region coordinates based on your screen resolution or the game's window size. The regions are defined in the script as (x, y, width, height) and correspond to areas where key presses need to be simulated.
